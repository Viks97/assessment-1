                by Paulo Coelho<br>

                Price 150</h2>

            <p>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling
                in its powerful simplicity and soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago
                who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the
                Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of
                whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago
                will be able to surmount the obstacles in his path. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly
                goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story
                of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of
                listening to our hearts..</p>

                1984<br>

                by George Orwell<br>

                Price 180<br>
            </h2>

            <p>Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting
                as
                its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George
                Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find
                individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of
                television,
                the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required
                reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.

                Price 200
            </h2>

            <p>The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career. This
                exemplary novel of the Jazz Age has been acclaimed by generations of readers. The story is of the
                fabulously
                wealthy Jay Gatsby and his new love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island
                at a
                time when The New York Times noted "gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession," it is an
                exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s. The Great Gatsby is one of the great classics of
                twentieth-century literature.

                by Ernest Hemingway<br>

                Price 200</h2>

            <p>The last novel Ernest Hemingway saw published, The Old Man and the Sea has proved itself to be one of the
                enduring works of American fiction. It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a
                relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Using the simple, powerful
                language of a fable, Hemingway takes the timeless themes of courage in the face of defeat and personal
                triumph won from loss and transforms them into a magnificent twentieth-century classic.

            </h2>
            <p>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms
                and
                an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
                hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with
                instant
                critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this
                introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of
                Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the
                cruel
                dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first
                published
                in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A.
                Anderson

            <p>"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a
                gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a
                little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed
                quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were
                pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes." With it's startling,
                bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The Metamorphosis. It is
                the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object
                of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A
                harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The
                Metamorphosishas taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of
                twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden wrote, "Kafka is important to us because his predicament is the
                predicament of modern man."

            <p>Chess Story, also known as The Royal Game, is the Austrian master Stefan Zweig's final achievement,
                completed in Brazilian exile and sent off to his American publisher only a matter of days before his
                suicide in 1942. It is the only story in which Zweig looks at Nazism, and he does so with characteristic
                emphasis on the psychological.

                Travelers by ship from New York to Buenos Aires find that on board with them is the world champion of
                chess, an arrogant and unfriendly man. They come together to try their skills against him and are
                soundly defeated. Then a mysterious passenger steps forward to advise them and their fortunes change.
                How he came to possess his extraordinary grasp of the game of chess and at what cost lie at the heart of
                Zweig's story. This new translation of Chess Story brings out the work's unusual mixture of high
                suspense and poignant reflection.

            <p>“I’ve had a most amazing time....” So begins the Time Traveller’s astonishing firsthand account of his
                journey 800,000 years beyond his own era—and the story that launched H.G. Wells’s successful career and
                earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the
                imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our
                darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth. There
                he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize
                the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well. Published
                in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to
                Wells’s expert storytelling and provocative insight, The Time Machinewill continue to enthrall readers
                for generations to come.
